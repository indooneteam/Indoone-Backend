"""Agent 05 - the Intent Purity Extractor: what is being asked, and can it be answered free.

Two jobs, both deterministic:

* **Strip the grammar.** "1 ralli" means branch one; "repo 2 ge" means repository two;
  "branches galannu thorisu" means show the branches. The case marker is glue, not meaning,
  and anything keying on the noun has to see the noun.
* **Decide whether a model is needed at all.** A holiday question, a branch list and an
  unread-mail count are answered by a router that costs nothing. Saying so here, with a
  confidence, is what lets the pipeline skip a provider call instead of paying for a
  decision the words already made.

The stripper is deliberately timid, and that is the important part. An earlier version of
this idea stripped a suffix whenever a word ended in one, which turned "merge" into "mer"
and "diverge" into "diver". So a Romanised suffix is removed only when what remains is a
resource this agent knows, or when the token began with a digit. Kannada script suffixes are
removed freely because ಅಲ್ಲಿ and ಗೆ are never the end of an English verb.

This agent does not route anything by itself. The existing routers already answer these
questions, and adding a second router that also answers them is how a message ends up
claimed twice. It reports its verdict so the pipeline can log the case that matters: a
message this agent is sure is answerable for free, that no router actually answered.
